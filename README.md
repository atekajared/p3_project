# Customer Churn Prediction Project
## Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn using historical telecom customer data. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave so that proactive retention strategies can be applied.

The notebook covers the full workflow including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
## Objectives

* Analyze customer behavior data
* Prepare and preprocess features for modeling
* Train a classification model to predict churn
* Evaluate model performance with appropriate metrics
* Provide a baseline model for further improvement
## Dataset
The dataset contains customer-level information such as:

* Usage statistics
* Service plan features
* Customer support interactions
* Account attributes
* Churn label (target variable)
## Methods

The project follows these steps:

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Data cleaning and preprocessing
4. Feature encoding and scaling
5. Train/test split
6. Model training (Logistic Regression baseline)
7. Model evaluation using classification metrics
## Tools and Libraries

* Python
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
## How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter notebook file.
2. Install dependencies if needed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Ensure the dataset file is in the correct directory.
4. Run the notebook cells in order.

## Results

The project produces a baseline churn prediction model and evaluation metrics. The results can be used to guide future model improvements and deployment.

## Future Improvements
* Try additional machine learning models
* Perform hyperparameter tuning
* Add cross-validation
* Apply class imbalance techniques
* Create a deployment-ready prediction pipeline
